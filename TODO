- event log on play page
  - display most events (not focus/blur) in reverse chronological order

  - display dropped events? maybe greyed out?

- cosmetics
  - spinner in syncing state
  - freeze top 'Team X (name)' bar at top of window
    - include list of team members (from join information)?
  - do something nicer with per-question cursor information

- add missing URL handlers
  - put something at '/' and '/quiz/'
  - possibly move '/quiz/<quizid>/play' to just '/quiz/<quizid>/'

- validate incoming user events
  - check contents (on both client and server)
  - only admin should post ask/lock/reveal events

- require auth for access to admin?
  - could generate cookie at quiz creation time
  - password protect?

- marking page in admin area
  - display answers for each team
  - exact match to canonical answer is automatically correct
  - add non-canonical answers manually, automatically propagate
  - how to handle number of marks? store map of answer:marks?

- view-as-team page in admin area
  - read-only version of play page
  - observe team activity in real-time
