- require password to join team
  - generate random 6-character string at team creation time
  - select team, redirect to password entry, redirect to name entry
  - enter name at same time as password?
  - only get cookie once through all of the above (cookie includes quizid so not set forever)

- event log on play page
  - display most events (not focus/blur) in reverse chronological order
  - hopefully avoid potential confusion over what happened
  - display dropped events? maybe greyed out?

- cosmetics
  - spinner in syncing state
  - freeze top 'Team X (name)' bar at top of window
    - include list of team members (from join information)?
  - do something nicer with per-question cursor information

- add missing URL handlers
  - put something at '/' and '/quiz/'
  - possibly move '/quiz/<quizid>/play' to just '/quiz/<quizid>/'

- require auth for access to admin?
  - could generate cookie at quiz creation time
  - password protect?

- marking page in admin area
  - display answers for each team
  - exact match to canonical answer is automatically correct
  - add non-canonical answers manually, automatically propagate
  - how to handle number of marks? store map of answer:marks?

- automatically read out answers when asked?
